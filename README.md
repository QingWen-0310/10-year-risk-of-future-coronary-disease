# 10-year-risk-of-future-coronary-disease

This repo is dedicated to the prediction of the 10-year-risk of having future coronary disease. The version of the data used in this repo is obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression. 
The original data is collected from an ongoing cardiovascular disease study on patients of the town Framingham, and this is a longitudinal study. 

In this study, we use the available predictor variables in the data set to build a logistic model to form prediction of the risk of having coronary disease.
